#TSUMINO ENHANCED

What is Tsumino Enhanced?

It's a collection of configurable Enhancements for Tsumino.com.

These Enhancements include features that didn't quite make it into Tsumino, and tweaks to augment your experience.

It's free, open source, and easy to use.

Enjoy your Doujin just the way you want to.



#TSUMINO READER ENHANCEMENTS

##SLIDESHOW 
Configure how long you'd like to spend on each page. 

Too much text to read in that amount of time on a particular page?

Press SHIFT to pause the slideshow instantly so you can catch up.

Once you're finished reading, press SHIFT again to start the slideshow back up immediately.

The slideshow also features an unobtrusive timer that lets you know how long you have until the next page is loaded.

While this is enabled by default, you can easily disable it from the configuration page.



##SEAMLESS VIEWING
By enabling this Enhancement, you negate the need to load the entire Tsumino webpage again every time you flip through a Doujin.

Seamless Viewing simply loads the image you want, leaving the previous image in place until the new one is ready.

Once the new image is ready, you are automatically scrolled up to the top of the image, ready to start reading the next page.

This means faster load times, and not losing sight of the previous page until the instant the new page is loaded.



##UNSTICKIED HEADER
While it's normally quite clingy, with this Enhancement the Tsumino navigation bar will no longer follow you as you scroll down.

It will respect your personal space, and wait patiently at the top of the page until you scroll back up to see it again.

This Enhancement is enabled by default when using Seamless Viewing and Automatic Repositioning.



##AUTOMATIC REPOSITIONING
This Enhancement automatically scrolls you directly to the top of the doujin image once the page is loaded.

This lets you always see as much of the image as possible when the page is loaded, with no need to scroll manually.

This Enhancement is enabled by default when using Seamless Viewing.





#CONFIGURATION
Configuration is easy. 

Simply click the ENHANCED link at the top of any Tsumino.com page.

Pick and choose which Enhancements you want to use, and then configure them to your liking.
