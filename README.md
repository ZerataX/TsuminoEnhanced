# TsuminoEnhanced
A collection of customizable tweaks, enhancements, and new features for Tsumino.com.

The initial release of Tsumino Enhanced includes a few features and tweaks: 
* Slideshow functionality for the reader.
* Unstickied Header (reader only).
* Automatically scroll the reader to the top of the doujin image.
* A unified configuration page for all Tsumino Enhanced options.

I plan to add more features to this collection as time goes on.

To access these features, simply click the blue "ENHANCED" link in the Tsumino navigation bar at the top of any Tsumino page.
You'll be able to pick and choose which features you want, and which ones you don't.
Any applicable options for the various features will be included on this configuration page.
For the moment, you will need to refresh Tsumino after changing your Enhanced configuration.
I'll address this in the next update, more than likely.

####Planned Features:

#####Single Page view for the Reader.
All doujin images loaded on the same page. Just keep scrolling down. 
This version will use a "proximity-based" smart loading sequence. 
That means it will only load images adjacent to the one you're looking at.

#####Ajaxified reader. 
Simply loads the (next/previous) image in place, without needing to load the whole page again. A more seamless experience.
Will autoscroll back to the top when the image is loaded, and will be hotkey enabled. Will be compatible with the current Enhanced features.
